## 🚀 Task 03 Completed | Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy Infotech

### 🔐 Project Overview
The Password Complexity Checker is a cybersecurity tool designed to evaluate the strength of user passwords. It checks passwords against multiple security criteria and provides feedback to help users create stronger and more secure passwords.

### 🛠️ Key Features
- Checks minimum password length (≥8 characters)
- Validates the presence of:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Classifies passwords as **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**
- Provides actionable feedback to improve password strength

### ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters a password.
2. The tool evaluates it against security rules:
   - Length
   - Uppercase letters
   - Lowercase letters
   - Numbers
   - Special characters
3. Each passed rule increases the strength score.
4. Based on the score, the tool classifies the password and gives improvement suggestions.
